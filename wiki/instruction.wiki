Super Drag and Go (Beta) for IE9
超级拖拽(beta) for IE 9

Author: s.weyl
Version: 0.9.1.0 (beta)


If you know what "Super Drag and Go" is, you might need it. For more information or source code, please contact with me by e-mail (scarsty@gmail.com).


1. How to install and uninstall:

Need .NET Framework 4.0.

To install, you have to decompress the ZIP file into any directory, then open "Command Window" as Administrator, and switch to this directory, run "install".

Similarly, to uninstall, just do the same but run "uninstall".

If you want to use it in 64 bit IE, please run "install 64" and "uninstall 64".

You can also use "CustomDrag.exe" to modify the behavior of this BHO, or add a link of this program into IE tools menu. All settings will be deleted when uninstall.

Also you can use the msi file to install it automatically, but it might not work in 64 bit IE if you do like this.

Hope you can like it.


2. The "Search string":

Please search "{0}" in the engineering you prefer, then just copy the string in the address bar.
